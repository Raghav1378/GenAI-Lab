## ðŸš€ About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m **Raghav Ramani**, a college student and AI/ML enthusiast on a journey to master **Generative AI, RAG models, LLMs, and NLP pipelines**.  
This repository is my **personal lab** where I document my learning, experiments, and mini-projects.

Here, I combine **theory, practical coding examples, and projects** to build a strong AI/ML portfolio.

## ðŸ“š What Iâ€™m Learning

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: How retrieval and generation work together
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Experimenting with generation, embeddings, and fine-tuning
- **NLP & Transformers**: Tokenization, embeddings, sequence modeling
- **End-to-End AI Pipelines**: From data retrieval to response generation
- **Python & ML Tools**: HuggingFace Transformers, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, etc.

## ðŸ’¡ How You Can Explore My Work

- Check out the **`theory/` folder** for my RAG notes, step-by-step workflow, and practical examples.
- Explore **scripts or notebooks** to see my experiments in action.
- Everything is meant to be **educational and reproducible**.
