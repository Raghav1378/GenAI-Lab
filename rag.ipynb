      "\n",
      "### Understanding RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **A Simple Definition of RAG:**\n",
      "    RAG is like giving a super-smart student (a Large Language Model, or LLM) an open-book test. Instead of relying *only* on what it learned in \"school\" (its training data), RAG allows the LLM to look up specific, relevant information from a separate, up-to-date knowledge base *before* answering a question. This helps it provide more accurate, current, and factual responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Its Main Components and How They Work:**\n",
      "    RAG primarily involves three key stages:\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **a. Retrieval (The \"R\"):**\n",
      "        *   When you ask a question, a \"retriever\" component first searches through a vast library of documents (e.g., your company's internal wiki, a database of research papers, the latest news articles).\n",
      "        *   It doesn't just do a keyword search; it uses advanced techniques (like converting your question and document chunks into numerical representations called \"embeddings\") to find the pieces of information that are most semantically similar or relevant to your query.\n",
      "        *   Think of it finding the most relevant paragraphs or sections from thousands of pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **b. Augmentation (The \"A\"):**\n",
      "        *   Once the most relevant information is retrieved, it's not just handed directly to you. Instead, it's *added* to your original question, creating an \"augmented prompt.\"\n",
      "        *   This augmented prompt now contains both your original query and the contextually relevant information found by the retriever.\n",
      "        *   Example: Instead of \"What is RAG?\", the prompt might become: \"Using the following information: [retrieved definition of RAG], explain what RAG is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **c. Generation (The \"G\"):**\n",
      "        *   Finally, this augmented prompt (your question + the retrieved context) is sent to the Large Language Model (LLM).\n",
      "        *   The LLM then generates its answer, but crucially, it's now guided by the specific, external information provided in the prompt, rather than solely relying on its internal, pre-trained knowledge. This makes its answer much more grounded and factual.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **How It Differs from Regular LLM Generation:**\n",
      "    *   **Regular LLM Generation:** An LLM, when asked a question, generates an answer based *only* on the vast amount of data it was trained on (which can be billions of web pages, books, etc.). This data is static; it doesn't update itself in real-time. This can lead to:\n",
      "        *   **Outdated Information:** If the event happened after its training cutoff date.\n",
      "        *   **Hallucinations:** Making up plausible-sounding but incorrect facts.\n",
      "        *   **Lack of Specificity:** Not knowing details about proprietary or niche topics.\n",
      "    *   **RAG-Enhanced Generation:** With RAG, the LLM still uses its knowledge, but it's *empowered* with real-time or specific external data *before* it generates an answer. This is like giving the LLM fresh, relevant notes for every question, drastically improving accuracy, currency, and factual grounding.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Practical Examples of Its Use:**\n",
      "    *   **Customer Service Chatbots:** A chatbot can answer customer queries by retrieving up-to-date product manuals, FAQs, or support articles, ensuring accurate and consistent responses, even for new products or policy changes.\n",
      "    *   **Internal Knowledge Base Q&A:** Employees can ask natural language questions about company policies, HR benefits, or project documentation, and RAG will pull the exact relevant sections from internal documents to provide a precise answer.\n",
      "    *   **Medical Information Systems:** Doctors or researchers can query a vast database of medical journals and clinical trials, and RAG can retrieve the most relevant studies to help answer complex diagnostic or treatment questions.\n",
      "    *   **Legal Research:** Lawyers can use RAG to quickly find specific precedents, case law, or legislative text from a massive legal database, saving hours of manual searching.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Key Advantages and Limitations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Advantages:**\n",
      "        *   **Improved Accuracy & Reduced Hallucination:** Provides factual answers by grounding the LLM in real data.\n",
      "        *   **Access to Current Information:** Can use information that wasn't part of the LLM's original training data, keeping responses up-to-date.\n",
      "        *   **Transparency & Explainability:** Often allows users to see the source documents from which the information was retrieved, building trust.\n",
      "        *   **Cost-Effective:** Often cheaper than constantly re-training an entire LLM on new data.\n",
      "        *   **Domain-Specific Knowledge:** Can easily integrate proprietary or niche company data without extensive LLM fine-tuning.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Limitations:**\n",
      "        *   **Quality of Retrieved Data:** \"Garbage in, garbage out.\" If the retrieved documents are poor quality, irrelevant, or contradictory, the LLM's answer will suffer.\n",
      "        *   **Retrieval Effectiveness:** The retriever component might sometimes miss the most relevant information or retrieve too much irrelevant context, confusing the LLM.\n",
      "        *   **Context Window Limits:** LLMs have a limit to how much text they can process in a single prompt (their \"context window\"). If too much information is retrieved, it might get truncated.\n",
      "        *   **Complexity:** Designing and maintaining an effective RAG system (especially the retrieval part) can be complex, requiring careful indexing and chunking of documents.\n",
      "        *   **Latency:** The retrieval step adds a small amount of time to the overall response generation, though often negligible for most applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",

      "\n",
      "### **2.1 Data Loading & Cleaning:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The first step is to ingest your data from various sources and prepare it for processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Document Loaders:**\n",

      "\n",
      "### **2.2 The Workflow of Chunking (Text Splitting):**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chunking**, or text splitting, is arguably the most critical step for retrieval quality. LLMs have finite context windows, and sending an entire document is often impractical or impossible. More importantly, retrieval systems work best when they can pinpoint *specific, relevant pieces* of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Why Chunking is Critical:**\n",
      "    *   **LLM Context Window Limits:** Documents are often too large to fit into an LLM's input.\n",
      "    *   **Retrieval Granularity:** You want to retrieve precise, self-contained pieces of information, not entire chapters. A well-formed chunk should contain enough context to be meaningful on its own.\n",
      "    *   **Reducing Noise:** Smaller, focused chunks reduce the chance of irrelevant information diluting the LLM's attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Detailing Different Chunking Strategies:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Fixed-Size Chunking:**\n",
      "        *   **How it works:** Divides text into chunks of a predefined character or token count.\n",
      "        *   **Workflow:** Simple `text.split()` or tokenizers to count and split.\n",
      "        *   **Main Drawback:** Often breaks sentences or paragraphs mid-way, leading to incoherent chunks that lack complete semantic meaning. This can severely degrade retrieval quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Recursive Character Text Splitting:**\n",
      "        *   **How it works:** This is a more sophisticated and commonly used default. It attempts to split text based on a list of separators (e.g., `[\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"]`), trying the largest separator first. If a chunk is still too large, it recursively tries the next smaller separator.\n",
      "        *   **Workflow:**\n",
      "            1.  Split by double newline (`\\n\\n`) to preserve paragraphs.\n",
      "            2.  If chunks are still too big, split by single newline (`\\n`) to preserve lines/sentences.\n",
      "            3.  If still too big, split by space (` `) to preserve words.\n",
      "            4.  Finally, split by character if necessary.\n",
      "        *   **Benefit:** Tries to respect natural language boundaries, making chunks more semantically coherent than fixed-size splitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Semantic Chunking:**\n",
      "        *   **How it works:** This advanced method uses an **embedding model** to group semantically related sentences or paragraphs together, even if they are not contiguous in the original text (e.g., a topic discussed across multiple paragraphs with interspersed unrelated content). It identifies \"breaks\" in meaning, not just character counts.\n",
      "        *   **Workflow:**\n",
      "            1.  Split the document into very small, atomic units (e.g., sentences).\n",
      "            2.  Generate embeddings for each atomic unit.\n",
      "            3.  Calculate the similarity between adjacent unit embeddings.\n",
      "            4.  Identify \"breakpoints\" where similarity drops below a certain threshold, indicating a shift in topic.\n",
      "            5.  Combine units between breakpoints into larger, semantically cohesive chunks.\n",
      "        *   **Benefit:** Produces highly relevant and contextually rich chunks, improving retrieval precision.\n",
      "        *   **Complexity:** More computationally intensive due to multiple embedding calls and similarity calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Trade-offs of Chunk Size and Chunk Overlap:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Chunk Size:**\n",
      "        *   **Small Chunks:** More precise retrieval (less irrelevant info), but might lack sufficient context for the LLM. Higher embedding and storage costs due to more chunks.\n",
      "        *   **Large Chunks:** More context for the LLM, but higher chance of irrelevant information, harder for precise retrieval. Fewer chunks, potentially lower costs.\n",
      "        *   **Design Choice:** Experimentation is key. A common starting point is 200-500 tokens, but this is highly dependent on your domain and the nature of your questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Chunk Overlap:**\n",
      "        *   **How it works:** When splitting, a small section of text from the end of one chunk is included at the beginning of the next chunk.\n",
      "        *   **Benefit:** Helps maintain context across chunk boundaries, preventing critical information from being split exactly in half and losing its meaning. Reduces the \"lost in the middle\" problem.\n",
      "        *   **Trade-off:** Increases redundancy and storage/embedding costs slightly.\n",
      "        *   **Design Choice:** A typical overlap is 10-20% of the chunk size.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **2.3 The Embedding Process:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Once chunks are prepared, they need to be converted into a machine-readable format that captures their semantic meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Role of the Embedding Model:**\n",
      "    *   An **embedding model** (a type of transformer model) takes a piece of text (a chunk) and converts it into a high-dimensional vector of numbers (an **embedding**).\n",
      "    *   Crucially, these vectors are designed such that texts with similar meanings are represented by vectors that are \"close\" to each other in the vector space. This proximity allows for semantic search.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Considerations for Choosing an Embedding Model:**\n",
      "    *   **Performance (Speed & Cost):** Some models are faster and cheaper to run than others, critical for large datasets.\n",
      "    *   **Dimensionality:** The number of dimensions in the output vector (e.g., 384, 768, 1536). Higher dimensions can capture more nuance but increase storage and computational overhead for the **Vector Store**.\n",
      "    *   **Domain-Specificity:**\n",
      "        *   **General-purpose models** (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, `text-embedding-ada-002`) are good starting points.\n",
      "        *   For highly specialized domains (e.g., legal, medical, technical manuals), a **domain-specific embedding model** or a fine-tuned general model can significantly improve retrieval accuracy.\n",
      "    *   **License and Deployment:** Open-source models vs. proprietary API-based models. Self-hosting vs. managed services.\n",
      "    *   **Design Choice:** Benchmarking different embedding models on a representative sample of your data and queries is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **2.4 Vector Storage & Indexing:**\n",

      "The final step in the indexing pipeline is to store the generated embeddings and their associated metadata in a way that allows for fast and efficient retrieval.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Function of the Vector Store:**\n",
      "    *   A **Vector Store** (or Vector Database) is a specialized database designed to store, manage, and query high-dimensional vectors. It's the central repository for your RAG knowledge base.\n",
      "    *   It stores both the **vector embeddings** and the original **text chunks** (or references to them), along with any extracted **metadata**.\n",
      "    *   Examples include Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, Chroma, Milvus, and specialized offerings from cloud providers.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What an Index is in this Context:**\n",
      "    *   An **index** within a Vector Store is a data structure optimized for performing **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)** searches.\n",
      "    *   When you query the **Vector Store** with a user's query embedding, it doesn't perform a brute-force comparison against every single vector (which would be too slow for large datasets). Instead, it uses these indexes to quickly find the *approximate* nearest vectors.\n",
      "    *   **Common Indexing Algorithms:**\n",
      "        *   **Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW):** A graph-based algorithm that builds a multi-layer graph structure, allowing for very fast searches with high recall.\n",
      "        *   **Inverted File Index with Product Quantization (IVF_PQ):** Divides the vector space into clusters and quantizes vectors to reduce memory footprint.\n",
      "    *   **Why it's needed for fast searches:** These indexing algorithms enable the Vector Store to return relevant results within milliseconds, even when dealing with millions or billions of vectors, which is crucial for real-time user experiences.\n",
      "    *   **Design Choice:** The choice of Vector Store and its underlying indexing strategy depends on factors like scale, latency requirements, cost, and desired recall/precision trade-offs.\n",

      "\n",
      "## **3. Phase 2: The Retrieval & Generation Pipeline (The Real-Time \"Answering\" Process)**\n",
      "\n",
      "This pipeline executes every time a user submits a query. It's about intelligently finding the best context and using it to generate a helpful and accurate answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **3.1 Query Understanding & Transformation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Before even touching the **Vector Store**, it's often beneficial to enhance or clarify the user's raw query. A poorly formed or ambiguous query will lead to poor retrieval.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Improving the Query *Before* Searching:**\n",
      "    *   **Query Expansion:** Using an LLM to generate synonyms, related terms, or alternative phrasings of the user's query. This creates multiple search vectors, increasing the chances of finding relevant documents.\n",
      "    *   **Query Rephrasing:** An LLM can rephrase a conversational or vague query into a more concise, keyword-rich, or specific search query that is better suited for vector search. For example, \"Tell me about the latest AI trends\" might be rephrased to \"What are the cutting-edge advancements in artificial intelligence as of [current year]?\"\n",
      "    *   **Sub-Query Generation:** For complex multi-part questions, an LLM can break down the original query into several smaller, independent sub-queries. Each sub-query can then be used to retrieve context, and the combined context is used to answer the original complex question.\n",
      "    *   **Intent Recognition:** An LLM can identify the user's intent (e.g., \"summarize,\" \"compare,\" \"explain X,\" \"find a document\"). This intent can then guide the retrieval strategy (e.g., retrieve a single large document for summarization vs. multiple small facts for comparison).\n",
      "    *   **Design Choice:** Adding LLM-powered query transformation steps can significantly boost retrieval quality, especially for conversational interfaces, but adds latency and cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **3.2 Advanced Retrieval Techniques:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving beyond simple vector similarity search is crucial for robust RAG systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Hybrid Search:**\n",
      "    *   **Concept:** Combines the strengths of **semantic (vector) search** with traditional **keyword search**.\n",
      "    *   **Semantic Search (Vector Search):** Excellent for conceptual understanding, finding documents that are *about* the same thing even if they don't share exact keywords.\n",
      "    *   **Keyword Search (e.g., BM25, TF-IDF):** Excellent for finding exact matches, specific product names, codes, or terms that might not be captured well by embeddings (e.g., \"Error 404\").\n",
      "    *   **Workflow:**\n",
      "        1.  Perform a vector search on the query embedding.\n",
      "        2.  Perform a keyword search on the original query.\n",
      "        3.  Combine the results, often using a reciprocal rank fusion (RRF) algorithm, to produce a unified list of top candidate chunks.\n",
      "    *   **Benefit:** Maximizes both recall (finding all relevant documents) and precision (ensuring they are highly relevant).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Metadata Filtering:**\n",
      "    *   **Concept:** Leverages the structured **metadata** stored alongside your chunks to narrow down the search space or filter results.\n",
      "    *   **Workflow:**\n",
      "        *   **Pre-filtering:** Before performing a vector search, filter the entire index based on metadata (e.g., \"only search documents published after 2022\" or \"only search documents from the 'Product X' manual\"). This reduces the search space and improves relevance.\n",
      "        *   **Post-filtering:** Perform a broad vector search, then filter the retrieved results based on metadata (e.g., \"from the retrieved documents, only show those written by 'Dr. Smith'\").\n",
      "    *   **Benefit:** Crucial for applications requiring precise control over the source of information, improving accuracy and reducing irrelevant context.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Re-ranking:**\n",
      "    *   **Concept:** Instead of sending the top `N` chunks directly from the initial retrieval step to the LLM, you retrieve a larger set of candidates (e.g., `k=50`), and then use a more sophisticated, often smaller, language model (**Re-ranker**) to re-score and select the absolute best `n` (e.g., `n=5-10`) chunks.\n",
      "    *   **Workflow:**\n",
      "        1.  Initial retrieval (e.g., hybrid search) returns a moderately large set of candidate chunks.\n",
      "        2.  Each candidate chunk is paired with the original query.\n",
      "        3.  A **Re-ranker model** (e.g., a cross-encoder like `cohere/rerank-english-v2.0` or a fine-tuned BERT/RoBERTa model) scores how relevant each chunk is to the query.\n",
      "        4.  The top-scoring chunks are selected and sent to the LLM.\n",
      "    *   **Benefit:** Significantly improves the precision of the retrieved context, ensuring the LLM receives the most pertinent information. Re-rankers can understand query-document relationships more deeply than simple vector similarity.\n",
      "    *   **Design Choice:** Re-ranking adds latency and cost but is highly effective for improving answer quality, especially when initial retrieval is noisy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **3.3 Prompt Augmentation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the most relevant chunks are retrieved, they need to be seamlessly integrated into the LLM's input.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Role of a Prompt Template:**\n",
      "    *   A **Prompt Template** is a predefined structure that combines the user's original query, system instructions for the LLM, and the retrieved context into a single, coherent input string for the **Generator (LLM)**.\n",
      "    *   **Example Structure:**\n",
      "        ```\n",
      "        You are a helpful assistant. Answer the user's question based ONLY on the provided context.\n",
      "        If the answer cannot be found in the context, state that you don't have enough information.\n",

      "        ```\n",
      "    *   **Importance:** A well-designed **Prompt Template** guides the LLM to use the provided context, avoid hallucination, and adhere to specific output formats. It's where you define the LLM's persona and constraints.\n",
      "    *   **Design Choice:** Iterating on prompt templates is crucial. Experiment with different instructions, context formatting, and placement of the query relative to the context.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **3.4 Generation and Source Attribution:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The final stage is where the LLM synthesizes the answer and, critically, attributes its sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **How the Generator (LLM) Synthesizes the Final Answer:**\n",
      "    *   The **Generator (LLM)** receives the augmented prompt (query + instructions + retrieved context).\n",
      "    *   It then uses its vast knowledge and reasoning capabilities, *constrained by the provided context*, to formulate a natural language answer.\n",
      "    *   The quality of the generated answer is directly dependent on the relevance and coherence of the retrieved context.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Workflow for Providing Citations:**\n",
      "    *   **Concept:** Linking parts of the generated answer back to the specific **chunks** or original documents from which the information was derived. This builds trust, allows for fact-checking, and reduces perceived hallucination.\n",
      "    *   **Workflow:**\n",
      "        1.  During the indexing pipeline, ensure each chunk is associated with its original document ID, page number, or URL (i.e., its **metadata**).\n",
      "        2.  When the LLM generates the answer, it can be prompted to output not just the answer but also a reference to the source. This can be challenging for the LLM to do perfectly.\n",
      "        3.  **Post-processing for Citations:** A more robust approach often involves a post-processing step:\n",
      "            *   Compare sentences or phrases in the generated answer to the retrieved chunks using similarity (e.g., semantic or keyword overlap).\n",
      "            *   Identify which chunk (and thus which original document/page) contributed most to each part of the answer.\n",
      "            *   Present these as clickable links or footnotes alongside the answer.\n",
      "    *   **Design Choice:** Implementing robust source attribution is complex but provides immense value in enterprise RAG systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Best Practice for Handling Cases Where No Relevant Context is Found:**\n",
      "    *   **Explicitly State Lack of Information:** If the retrieval pipeline returns no relevant chunks, or if the LLM, despite having context, cannot find an answer within it, the LLM should be instructed to explicitly state that it cannot answer based on the provided information.\n",
      "    *   **Avoid Guessing/Hallucination:** This is a critical instruction in the **Prompt Template** (\"If the answer cannot be found in the context, state that you don't have enough information.\").\n",
      "    *   **Suggest Next Steps:** Offer to search a broader knowledge base, ask for clarification, or escalate to a human agent.\n",
      "    *   **Design Choice:** This prevents the system from generating confidently incorrect or misleading answers, preserving user trust.\n",

      "\n",
      "Imagine you've hired the world's most diligent and intelligent **Expert Research Assistant** to help you answer complex questions from a vast, ever-growing library of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Indexing Pipeline (The Assistant's Learning Phase):**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Data Loading & Cleaning:** Your assistant first goes through all the new books, articles, and reports you give them. They don't just dump them on a pile; they carefully unpackage them, discard any torn pages or irrelevant advertising (cleaning), and identify what type of document each is (e.g., a scientific paper, a company report, a news article – **Document Loaders** and initial pre-processing).\n",
      "2.  **Chunking:** Instead of reading an entire 500-page book for every question, the assistant breaks each document down into focused, digestible \"knowledge cards\" (chunks). They're smart about it: they try to keep complete ideas together, even if they span a few sentences or paragraphs (e.g., **Recursive Character Text Splitting**). If a specific idea is too long for one card, they'll make sure the next card starts with a bit of the previous one to maintain flow (**Chunk Overlap**). For really complex topics, they might even group sentences based on their core meaning, creating \"semantic summaries\" on cards, regardless of where they appeared in the original text (**Semantic Chunking**).\n",
      "3.  **Embedding:** For each knowledge card, the assistant creates a highly abstract, multi-dimensional \"mental fingerprint\" – a unique conceptual signature (**Embedding Model**). Cards with similar ideas will have similar mental fingerprints.\n",
      "4.  **Vector Storage & Indexing:** All these knowledge cards, along with their mental fingerprints and any important details like author, date, and original source (metadata), are meticulously organized into an advanced, cross-referenced catalog system (**Vector Store**). This catalog isn't alphabetical; it's designed so the assistant can instantly find cards with similar mental fingerprints, even among millions, using sophisticated \"conceptual maps\" (**Indexes** like HNSW).\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Retrieval & Generation Pipeline (The Assistant Answering Your Questions):**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Query Understanding & Transformation:** When you ask a question, the assistant doesn't just take it literally. If your question is vague (\"Tell me about AI\"), they might ask for clarification or mentally rephrase it into more specific sub-questions (\"What are the latest advancements in AI ethics?\" or \"What are the common applications of AI in healthcare?\") to guide their search (**Query Understanding & Transformation**).\n",
      "2.  **Advanced Retrieval Techniques:** Now, the assistant goes to their catalog:\n",
      "    *   They use their conceptual maps to find cards semantically related to your question (**Semantic Search**).\n",
      "    *   But they also quickly scan for exact keywords you mentioned, just in case (**Keyword Search**). This is their **Hybrid Search**.\n",
      "    *   If you specified, \"Only tell me about documents from last year\" or \"Only reports by Dr. Smith,\" they use those filters to narrow down their search before or after looking at the cards (**Metadata Filtering**).\n",
      "    *   Crucially, they don't just grab the first few cards. They pull out a larger stack of potentially relevant cards (e.g., 50), then carefully review and re-evaluate them, picking only the absolute top 5-10 most pertinent ones to focus on (**Re-ranking**). They're like a meticulous editor, ensuring only the most relevant information makes it to the final draft.\n",
      "3.  **Prompt Augmentation:** The chosen, highly relevant knowledge cards are then neatly arranged and presented to the assistant's \"thinking engine\" (the LLM), along with your original question and clear instructions: \"Answer this question *only* using the information on these cards. Do not guess.\" This structured presentation is the **Prompt Template**.\n",
      "4.  **Generation and Source Attribution:** The thinking engine, guided by the instructions and the provided cards, synthesizes a concise, accurate answer. As it speaks, it notes exactly which knowledge card (and thus which original book/page) each piece of information came from, providing you with verifiable **citations**. If, after all this meticulous research, the assistant truly finds no information on their cards to answer your question, they will honestly tell you, \"Based on the information I have, I cannot answer that question,\" rather than making something up. This is their commitment to **handling no relevant context**.\n",
      "\n",
