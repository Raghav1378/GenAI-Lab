Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury.
Mars is often called the 'Red Planet' because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance.
The atmosphere of Mars is very thin, composed mainly of carbon dioxide (95.32%), with smaller amounts of nitrogen and argon.
Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are thought to be captured asteroids.
A day on Mars (a 'sol') is slightly longer than an Earth day, lasting 24.6 hours. A Martian year is significantly longer, lasting 687 Earth days.
Mars has the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, and the largest canyon, Valles Marineris.
The first successful Mars flyby was NASA's Mariner 4 mission in 1965. The first rovers to land, Sojourner, Spirit, and Opportunity, arrived much later.
Liquid water cannot exist on the surface of Mars long-term due to its low atmospheric pressure, but scientists believe large amounts of water ice are trapped at its poles.
