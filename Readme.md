### 🚀 Generative AI Developer | LLM Orchestration | Agentic Workflows

I am a passionate AI enthusiast currently building a deep expertise in Generative AI. I am documenting my journey from learning the basics of LLMs to building complex, self-reasoning Multi-Agent systems.

---

### 🧠 What I am Learning / Mastering Right Now
Currently, I am diving deep into **Agentic Design Patterns** and **Advanced RAG**.

- 🛠️ **LangChain:** Building modular LLM applications using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).
- 🕸️ **LangGraph:** Creating stateful, multi-agent systems with cycles and persistence.
- 🏗️ **Agent Architectures:** Implementing ReAct, Plan-and-Execute, and Multi-agent collaboration patterns.
- 📚 **Vector Databases:** Optimizing retrieval with Pinecone, ChromaDB, and FAISS.
