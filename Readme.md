# Hi there, I'm Raghav Ramani 

### 🚀 Generative AI Developer | LLM Orchestration | Agentic Workflows

I am a passionate AI enthusiast currently building a deep expertise in Generative AI. I am documenting my journey from learning the basics of LLMs to building complex, self-reasoning Multi-Agent systems.

---

### 🧠 What I am Learning / Mastering Right Now
Currently, I am diving deep into **Agentic Design Patterns** and **Advanced RAG**.

- 🛠️ **LangChain:** Building modular LLM applications using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).
- 🕸️ **LangGraph:** Creating stateful, multi-agent systems with cycles, persistence, and human-in-the-loop.
- 🏗️ **Agent Architectures:** Implementing ReAct, Plan-and-Execute, and Multi-agent collaboration patterns.
- 📚 **Vector Databases:** Optimizing retrieval with Pinecone, ChromaDB, and FAISS.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

> **Overview:** My stack is built for **Production-Grade AI**. I focus on low-latency inference (Groq), stateful orchestration (LangGraph), and high-precision retrieval (Advanced RAG).

### 📁 Featured GenAI Projects

| Project | Tech Stack | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Multi-Agent Research Catalyst]** | `LangGraph`, `GPT-4o`, `Tavily` | A **Plan-and-Execute** system where a Manager agent decomposes queries into sub-tasks for specialized researchers, featuring a **Self-Correction loop**. |
| **[Agentic SQL Insights]** | `LangChain`, `Groq`, `PostgreSQL` | An autonomous SQL agent with **Self-Healing** capabilities—it catches its own syntax errors and retries queries automatically. |
| **[Advanced RAG Engine]** | `LlamaIndex`, `ChromaDB` | Implements **Hybrid Search** and **Reranking** to solve complex, multi-part user queries with high precision and source citations. |

### 🧬 Deep Dive: Why LangGraph?
I specialize in building **Stateful Agents**. Unlike linear chains, my systems use:
* **Persistence:** Saving thread states so agents "remember" past interactions across sessions.
* **Cycles:** Allowing agents to loop back and re-evaluate work if a task wasn't completed successfully.
* **Human-in-the-loop:** Implementing "breakpoints" where the agent pauses for human approval before taking sensitive actions.

### 📈 GenAI Roadmap & Progress

- [x] **Foundations:** Prompt Engineering, Temperature/Top-P tuning, Hallucinations.
- [x] **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):** PDF Chatbots, semantic search.
- [ ] **LangGraph Specialization:** Human-in-the-loop, time-travel debugging.
- [ ] **Fine-tuning:** PEFT/LoRA for domain-specific tasks.
- [ ] **Evaluation:** Using LangSmith and RAGAS for testing AI quality.
